# Horiseon Website Code Refactoring

## Overview
The project's objective is to make the Horiseon website more accessible, ensuring people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## Description
This repository contains the refactored files relating to the Horiseon website. The project required reordering the CSS stylesheet to align with the content in the index.HTML file, converting div elements into semantic elements, removing excess CSS selectors, adding class and id selectors when appropriate, modifying HTML classes and ids where appropriate, and more.
